# Thrive or Die Website Future Bucket List

### Visual

- [ ] Make mobile compatible overlays (by touch)
- [ ] Get rid of the same and excessive CSS rules rendering in the background (through component inheritance I believe, my fault for not entirely understanding how rules pass down)
- [ ] Consider making the hero component scss a modular mixin and write on top of it based on if the layout is in interview or home/artist page

### Function

- [ ] Make the name of artists in the home header anchored to their artist pages
- [ ] Rebuild the way containers take conditional data so an undefined data error won't throw when loading something that doesn't fill out any form of expected data in a conditional

### Data

- [ ] Run all pictures through Gatsby Img and make interview pages be able to get an img/ folder of the same slug and create an object with them all to use anywhere

### Accessibility

  "bio": "One of my favorite things about @foxsky is his ability to blend adorable party melodies with aggressive crowd-pleasing hype. We first came across the Californian producer by organizing a premiere of his 'My Friend the Yellowtail' collab with NEGITORO — a track which flipped nintendo-style glossy synth pop into a rave-y house jam. Since then, he's continued to push forward with an accessible yet punchy club sound through TREKKIE TRAX releases like the trapped out VIP of 'Yellowtail' and his juke-meets-half-timed-bass remix of Carpainter's 'Noble Arts'. He also released the dark and tech-y 'Melt' through Play Me, and now he's sharing an impressive weekly production sketch series, leading with the blippy and apocalyptic 'Springz'. — NEST HQ"

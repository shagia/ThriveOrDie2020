  "bio": "Foxsky [foks-skee] is a 20 year old electronic music producer hailing from California. Involved in a wide range of music genres (most notably his takes on moombahton and 'dubstep') and remixing the likes of Childish Gambino, Adele, Zedd, and Girls Generation, Foxsky is a regular feature on San Francisco Bay Area's radio station LIVE105.3 and other EDM blogs around the world. With the incredible support from BBC Radio, MOOMBA+ Records, and Electro-Bangers amongst many others, this bass loving hell hound is set for world domination (or at least domination of your music library)."
